"horrible app and horrible company. it's hard to get through and talk to anybody on the phone. I've had my account for over 10 years and they haven't lowered my rates once despite calling and asking. the app keeps wanting to verify my identity and I've scanned my ID numerous times at this point and it won't accept it. I've already gone online and updated all the info I need, but yet the god damn app won't let me in. Just an overall terrible company.",1,2025-06-05,Chase,Google Play Store
"these people do not listen, even when they say they understand. I told chase that this charge was a scam, they said they understood but they lied. not only did the people where this scam occurred from, sent me a notification telling me that a scam is a working advertisement, and when I went online to research this organization, the internet says it is a scam. these people take care of my money and when they reversed my claim against this scam, well that there says they don't care about me or my",1,2025-06-05,Chase,Google Play Store

"Easy to use, nice design, clean feeling. I've said it once before and I'll say it again with more detail. The cash back feature on this app is my favorite. It beats other banking apps that I've used. Other apps will only allow cash back as a statement credit. Chase gives you the option of statement credit or cash back sent to another checking account. Because of this, I am willing to keep using chase instead of other banks. Thank you, Chase.",5,2025-06-04,Chase,Google Play Store

"Don't use this bank or app unless you want to be constantly asked what you are doing with your money and whatnot. I understand that scamming has become more rampant lately, but good grief. Why I got to explain myself about what I do with my money? Also, if they close your account(s), don't expect an answer if you ask them. They'll just tell you that they don't know when they clearly do. (As a former customer, I feel like I have the right to know why my account(s) were closed)",1,2025-06-04,Chase,Google Play Store

I love Chase banking. They explain exactly how the process of a returned item is credited back to your account & they accomplish that right away. The online banking is easy to do & there are no problems to file a claim. It's simple & they are always kind & patient. I use my Chase debit card alot so when I have to return a item they simply credit that particular sale item & they take it from there. Simplicity is how they work.

Terrible experience for foreign travel. I'm not getting fraud alerts when I travel. It's just declining my card intermittently. their documentation all says that you don't need to report travel(and can't self service report travel) because of their magical fraud alerts(which aren't working and none of the 5 people they've transferred me to know how to set up).
