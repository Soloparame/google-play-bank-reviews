"horrible app and horrible company. it's hard to get through and talk to anybody on the phone. I've had my account for over 10 years and they haven't lowered my rates once despite calling and asking. the app keeps wanting to verify my identity and I've scanned my ID numerous times at this point and it won't accept it.

"Don't use this bank or app unless you want to be constantly asked what you are doing with your money and whatnot. I understand that scamming has become more rampant lately, but good grief.

"Galaxy S25 Ultra This is probably the most user friendly banking app I use. It just barely edges out my Navy Federal app. Time is a resource I have little of.

"I love Wells Fargo Bank because they always take good care of me. They watch out for anything that might be fraudulent, and they alert me to ensure that the questionable expense was mine. When people have tried to scam me, they don't pay the bad guy. When I file a claim for fraud, they investigate and if they have already paid it, they will return the money to me while they investigate. If I overdraw my account, they give me two days to make a deposit before charging me an overdraft fee.",5,2025-05-20 17:24:42,Wells Fargo,Google Play Store,POSITIVE,0.9148758053779602
